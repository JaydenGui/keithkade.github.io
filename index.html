            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
            I am a computer scientist attending Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, TX. I'm specializing in Human Computer Interaction and Intelligent Information Systems. That means I think software should be smart and look good too. Thus, I am taking electives such as Artificial Intelligence, Info Storage and Retrieval, and Design for the Web. I also work at the Interface Ecology lab, where I study curation, creativity, and network visualization on the web. 
            </P>
            <p>
            In addition to computers, I love politics, golf, and comic books. I don't have as much time to draw as I would like, but you can see some of my work on this <a href="http://kade-keith.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a>.
            </P>

            You can also connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=312421498">LinkedIn</a>

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
            In the short term, I am exploring career opportunities for when I graduate next year. Last summer I had a great time interning with Verizon as a developer, and I hope to line up another internship for the upcoming summer. In the long term, I plan to make awesome software that helps people. I think the future is on the web, so I do a lot with web technologies and can see myself continuing to do so.
