    <h1>Citation Viz</h1>
    <p> Users will explore relationships among citation network based on their own specified criteria. Users will set rules of attraction/repulsion, and the papers will rearrange in space to reflect those rules in real time. This will allow for the user to better understand the network and how papers and authors in it relate to each other. Ideally, users would come in with some knowledge of the scholarly works in the corpus. This interface will let them see new clusters. Another key feature is the formation of a personal network, composed of nodes the user selects. This will let the user examine the relationships of select nodes in more detail.</p>
