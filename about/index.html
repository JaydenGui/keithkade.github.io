    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
    I am a computer scientist attending Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, TX. I'm specializing in Human Computer Interaction and Intelligent Information Systems. That means I think software should be smart and look good too. Thus, I am taking electives such as Artificial Intelligence, Info Storage and Retrieval, and Design for the Web. I also work at the Interface Ecology lab, where we develop next gen human/computer interfaces. Between my research work and a summer internship with Verizon, I have 2 years experience working on software development teams outside of the classroom. I've worked on major projects in Javascript/HTML5, C++, Python, and Java.

    In addition to computers, I love politics, golf, and comic books. I don't have as much time to <span class="tooltip">draw<span><img id="rorshac" src="/img/rorshac.png"/></span></span> as I would like, but you can see some of my work on this <a target="_blank" href="http://kade-keith.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a>.

    You can also connect with me on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=312421498">LinkedIn</a>. Most of my code is on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/keithkade/">GitHub</a>

    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>
    For the current summer, I am interning at IBM's <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/employment/us/extremeblue/">Extreme Blue</a> program. I'll be working at the RTP office, so I'm looking forward to a summer of tees, trees, and phds! Oh, and I'll probably write some code while I'm at it :)
