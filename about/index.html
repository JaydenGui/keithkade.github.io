    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
    I am a computer scientist in my senior year at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, TX. I'm specializing in Human Computer Interaction, Information Visualization, and Front-End development. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I research at the Interface Ecology lab, where we develop next gen human/computer interfaces. Between my research work and summer internships with Verizon and IBM, I have 3 years experience working on software development teams outside of the classroom. I've worked on major projects in Javascript/HTML5/CSS, C++, Python, and Java.
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition to computers, I love politics, golf, and comic books. I create art sometimes, and upload my work for class to their respective pages under "classes." I don't have as much time to <span class="tooltip">draw<span><img id="rorshac" src="/img/rorshac.png"/></span></span> as I would like, but you can see some of my older stuff on this <a target="_blank" href="http://kade-keith.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a>.
    </P>
    <p>
    You can also connect with me on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=312421498">LinkedIn</a>. Most of my code is on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/keithkade/">GitHub</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Future</h2>
    <p>
    I just wrapped up an internship with IBM's <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/employment/us/extremeblue/">Extreme Blue</a> program in North Carolina. I am currently pursuing full time opportunities for when I graduate in May 2016. Check out my resume if you want to see more about my experience and skills.
