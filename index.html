                Hello there! You have found my personal web page. The site (specifically the projects section) is currently under construction, so please bear with me. In the meantime feel free to check out my resume and my research!
            </p>
            <p>
            I am an aspiring computer scientist attending Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, TX. I'm specializing in front end development and intelligent information systems. That means a write a lot of Javascript and think AI and Information Storage and Retrieval are super cool. On campus I work at the Interface Ecology lab, where I study curation, creativity, and network visualization on the web. 
            </P>
            <p>
            In addition to computers, I love politics, golf, and comic books.
            </P>
