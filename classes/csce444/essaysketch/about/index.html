                <h3>Essaysketch - The Web isn't as it seems</h3>
                <p>
                    As the web becomes more and more dynamic, thinking about it in traditional terms is insufficient. The goal of this site
                    is to show that to the user. 
                </p>
                <a name="tworoads"></a>
                <h3>Two Roads Diverge</h3>
                <p>
                    User is presented with a navigational choice between two paths reminiscent of the Robert Frost poem. 
                </p>
                <a name="fountain"></a>
                <h3>Fountain</h3>
                <p>
                    Juxtaposed with the natural setting, the user finds a urinal labelled as a fountain. 
                    It has been places there by some other internet user. 
                </p>
                <a name="chasm"></a>
                <h3>Chasm</h3>
                <p>
                    The user finds a chasm in the ground. One side is labeled and the other is knowledge. 
                    Hopefully this causes the user to question their own conceptual model.
                </p>
                <a name="memex"></a>
                <h3>Memex</h3>
                <p>
                    User generated content serves as a way for web citizens to create their own trails
                </p>
                <a name="crossroads"></a>                
                <h3>Crossroads</h3>
                <p>
                    User sees a sign marking a crossroads. Sign has labels for the directional options.
                </p>
                <a name="portals"></a> 
                <h3>Portals</h3>
                <p>
                    User sees portals through which they can travel. Can be thought of as hypermedia links. 
                </p>
                <a name="monolith"></a> 
                <h3>Monolith - Landmark / Filter</h3>
                <p> 
                    User sees monolith akin to the one from 2001 a space odyssey. 
                    At first there are multiple navigation choices but they fade away as the monolith directs the user.
