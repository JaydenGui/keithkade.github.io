            <h2>Welcome</h2>
            <p>
            You have found my personal web page. The site (specifically the projects section, it is quite slow) is currently under construction, so please bear with me. In the meantime feel free to check out my resume and my lab's research!
            </p>
            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
            I am an aspiring computer scientist attending Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, TX. I'm specializing in Human Computer Interaction and Intelligent Information Systems. That means I think software should be smart and look good too. Thus I am taking classes such as Artificial Intelligence, Info Storage and Retrieval, and Design for the Web. I also work at the Interface Ecology lab, where I study curation, creativity, and network visualization on the web. 
            </P>
            <p>
            In addition to computers, I love politics, golf, and comic books.
            </P>
            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
            In the short term, I am exploring career opportunities for when I graduate next year. Last summer I had a great time interning with Verizon as a developer, and I hope to line up another internship for the upcoming summer. In the long term, I plan to make awesome software that helps people. I think the future is on the web, so I do a lot with web technologies and can see myself continuing to do so in the future. The instant gratification you get from web programming is addicting.
