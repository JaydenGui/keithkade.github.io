    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <p>
    I am a computer scientist in my senior year at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, TX. I'm specializing in Human Computer Interaction, Information Visualization, and Front-End development. I research at the Interface Ecology lab, where we develop next gen human/computer interfaces.

    In addition to computers, I love politics, golf, and comic books. I create art sometimes, and upload my work for class to their respective pages under "classes." I've got somee old  <span class="tooltip">drawings<span><img id="rorshac" src="/img/compressed/rorshac.png"/></span></span>  on this <a target="_blank" href="http://kade-keith.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a> as well.
